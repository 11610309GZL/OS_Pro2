## Task 1:  ARGUMENT PASSING

### Data Structures

- list of pointer  ```int* argc```

  This pointer list stores the address of the arguments. Used in method ```setup_stack```.



#### process.c

- Modify the ```process_create```  : Use ```strtok_r``` to extract the filename in the input string. Use the real name to create 

- Modify the ```setup_stack``` : Initialize a stack and push the stack according to the **80x86 convention**. Here is an example: ```/bin/ls -l foo bar```

### Algorithms

#### Analysis

Process of creating a new process:

- First call the method ```process_execute``` 



The key part of this task is to push the argument according to the **80x86 convention**. We implement this process in the ```setup_stack``` method.

```c
/* in setup_stack */

// copy the command stirng (file_name)
char * copy = malloc(strlen(file_name)+1);
strlcpy (copy, file_name, strlen(file_name)+1);

// use the copied string to get argc
for (token = strtok_r (copy, " ", &save_ptr); token != NULL;
     token = strtok_r (NULL, " ", &save_ptr))
    argc++;

// initialize pointer list: int* argv
int *argv = calloc(argc,sizeof(int));

// push the argv value
for (token = strtok_r (file_name, " ", &save_ptr),i=0; token != NULL;
     token = strtok_r (NULL, " ", &save_ptr), i++)
{
    *esp -= strlen(token) + 1;
    memcpy(*esp,token,strlen(token) + 1);
    argv[i]=*esp;
}

// word align, world size is 4, every loop increase the stack pointer by 1 byte 
while((uint32_t)*esp % 4 != 0)
{
    *esp-=sizeof(char);
    char x = 0;
    memcpy(*esp,&x,sizeof(char));
}

// push null pointer
int zero = 0;
*esp -= sizeof(int);
memcpy(*esp,&zero,sizeof(int));

// push argv[] pointer
for(i=argc-1;i>=0;i--)
{
    *esp-=sizeof(uint32_t);
    memcpy(*esp,&argv[i],sizeof(uint32_t));
}

// push the poniter which points to argv
uint32_t ptr = *esp;
*esp-=sizeof(uint32_t);
memcpy(*esp,&ptr,sizeof(uint32_t));

// push argc
*esp-=sizeof(int);
memcpy(*esp,&argc,sizeof(int));

// push return address which is 0
*esp-=sizeof(int);
memcpy(*esp,&zero,sizeof(int));

// do free
free(copy);
free(argv);
```



 ### Synchronization

Make the creation of stack atomically in case of safety problem.

```c
  /* Create the stack atomically */
  old_level = intr_disable ();

  /* Stack frame for kernel_thread(). */
  kf = alloc_frame (t, sizeof *kf);
  kf->eip = NULL;
  kf->function = function;
  kf->aux = aux;

  /* Stack frame for switch_entry(). */
  ef = alloc_frame (t, sizeof *ef);
  ef->eip = (void (*) (void)) kernel_thread;

  /* Stack frame for switch_threads(). */
  sf = alloc_frame (t, sizeof *sf);
  sf->eip = switch_entry;
  sf->ebp = 0;

  intr_set_level (old_level);
```



### Rational

The algorithm is simple, and easy to debug. We just follow the description and push the arguments. After finishing using the char list, we free the space manually to save memory.



## Task 2:  Process Control System Call

### Data Structure

There are significant changes in ```thread.c```  and the ```struct thread```, also create a new struct ```child_data```

```c
// changes in struct thread

 /* exit status, every thread's initial exit status is INIT_EXIT_STATUS except for the kernel thread*/
int exit_status;

/* after child  load, pass sucess to parent->child_load_success */
bool child_load_success;			

/* lock of load, when the child is loading and executing, lock its parent */
struct semaphore load_sema;

/* list of this process' children, list elem is struct child_data*/
struct list children;

/* parent of this process */
struct thread* parent; 

/* the child this process is waiting, in pintos a process only wait one child at one time */
struct child_data * waiting_child;
```



```c
// struct child_data

/* this struct is mainly used for wait. Some information is stored in this struct in case that the child exited before the parent wait for it. 
This also implies a relation between processes. */

struct child_data {
      int tid;                       // tid of the child process
      struct list_elem child_elem;   // list elem for struct thread->children
      int exit_status;   /*store its exit status to pass it to its parent */

      /*store wheather the child process is exited, if exited the wait system call 	don't UP the wait_sema */
      bool is_exited;
   	 /* lock the parent when it is waiting for this child process */
      struct semaphore wait_sema;
};

```



The corresponding modifies are in the <thread.c>  



The other big changes are in the ```syscall.c```, where the system call handler and system call functions are implemented. And function ```is_mapped_user_vaddr``` check whether the pointer address is in the user space, which is used in system calls to check the bad address.



### Algorithms

#### User Process

​	In ```init_thread``` , initialize ```load_sema```, ```children``` list and set ```exit_status``` to **INIT_EXIT_STATUS** which is a predefined special int . If a thread is created but not load successfully, its ```exit_status``` is **INIT_EXIT_STATUS**, then the exit process will detect it and change the ```exit_status``` to -1.  

​	In ```thread_create```, except for creating a ```struct thread ```, we also need to create a ```staruct child_data``` for this process and its ```parent``` is the current thread. ```tid``` is equal to the thread ```tid ```. ```is_exited``` is false. Initialize ```wait_sema``` with resource 0. Then push the ```child_elem``` to the ```children``` list of its parent (current thread) .

​	In ```process_execute ``` ,  this is the start point of a user process. After the new thread is being created, we need to lock its parent until the result of loading ( in ```child_load_success``` ) is got in method ```start_process``` . The reason to do so is that we need to get the right result after the load operation. If there is no semaphore, we don't know when to check the load result.
